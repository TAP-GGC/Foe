# Foes
A web based local multiplayer fighting game developed in GGC's Technology Ambassador Program (TAP) in Spring 2023 by Alex Shaklee and Alec Burns. Taking inspiration from the game ROUNDS on Steam, we set out to make a fighting game that creates a state of tug of war. While each layer starts off with equal power, each time a player loses a round they are offered a powerup. These powerups are randomly generated and  stack with each other, meaning that winning too frequently often results in losing, which in turn powers up the former winner. The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game.
