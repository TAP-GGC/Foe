# Teaching JavaScript Fundamentals Through a MultiPlayer Fighting Game
## Description
* Difficulty Level: Intermediate
* Target Audience: High School - College
* Duration of Workshop: 2 hours
* Needed Materials: Computer, Internet Access, Visual Studio Code
* The goal of this project is to educate others about JavaScript basics while building a HTML/CSS webpage.

## Project Setup/Installation
### Description
Taking inspiration from the game ROUNDS on Steam, we set out to make a fighting game that creates a state of tug of war. While each layer starts off with equal power, each time a player loses a round they are offered a powerup. These powerups are randomly generated and stack with each other, meaning that winning too frequently often results in losing, which in turn powers up the former winner. The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game.
