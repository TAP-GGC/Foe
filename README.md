# Foes - Teaching JavaScript Fundamentals Through a MultiPlayer Fighting Game
## Description
* Difficulty Level: Intermediate
* Target Audience: High School - College
* Duration of Workshop: 2 hours
* Needed Materials: Computer, Internet Access, Visual Studio Code
* The goal of this project is to educate others about JavaScript basics while building a HTML/CSS webpage.
* Foes is a web-hosted project. This project is curated to peak the interest of non-IT and beginning IT majors.
By participating in the workshop, student will get to experiment with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code to immediately view their changes on their browser.
* The Technology Ambassador Program ([TAP](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

## Project Setup/Installation
### Description
Taking inspiration from the game ROUNDS on Steam, we set out to make a fighting game that creates a state of tug of war. While each layer starts off with equal power, each time a player loses a round they are offered a powerup. These powerups are randomly generated and stack with each other, meaning that winning too frequently often results in losing, which in turn powers up the former winner. The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game.
### Play Game
1. Click the following link: [Play Foes](https://aburns10.altervista.org/)
2. Click the "Please Click Here To Play Foes" link displayed on the page, which will take you to the main page where the game is being hosted.
3. To play, grab a friend and pick either Player 1 or Player 2.
4. Click the 'Start Game' button and use the designated keys for each player to play the game, until the end of the level is reached.
5. When the end of the level is reached the game will pause and a message at the bottom of the game screen will be displayed allowing the "loser" of the current level to pick a powerup for the next round.
6. After a power up is picked the game will continue. Keep playing and repeating step 5 until the end game screen is displayed.
7. Once the game is over click the 'Reset Game' button at the top of the screen to play again or close the browser to quit.

## Workshop Access 
There are two ways to access the Foes Workshops. The first way involves clicking a link to acccess CodePen: a website that allows users to edit/create basic webpages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The second way involves downloading a copy of the entire Foes Project onto your personal computer and changing the code on a code editor app. This workshop will use Visual Studio Code. Please choose the method that works best for you and your classroom needs.

2. After installing Git, you will need to get a copy of Foes. To do so please follow the "cloning" instructions by clicking this link: [Install Foes](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/Foe/blob/main/Documents/Installation%20Instructions/Install%20Foes.pdf). Please note that the following instructions will explain a little about what cloning is, but this is not an in depth explanation. To learn more about cloning with Git please click the following links: [What is a repository?](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) and [What is cloning?](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
3. The next step is to make sure or verify you have a code editor. Please keep in mind there are multiple code editor apps, but this Workshop will use Visual Studio Code. To get the instructions that explain how to install Visual Studio Code please click this link: [Install Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/Foe/blob/main/Documents/Installation%20Instructions/Install%20Visual%20Studio%20Code.pdf)
